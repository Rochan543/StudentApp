You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Fix and implement the following issues exactly as described.

---------------------------------------------------
1. USER PANEL – COURSE CLICK ERROR
---------------------------------------------------
When user clicks on a course that admin posted, it is not opening and shows “something went wrong”.

Fix:

- Clicking a course must open course details page with image of the course and detailed description and course broucher pdf (stored in cloudinary). 
- Route must load using courseId.
- Fetch course data from backend using courseId.
- Show proper error if course not found.

---------------------------------------------------
2. ADMIN PANEL – SCHEDULE MEETING NOT CREATING
---------------------------------------------------
Admin is unable to create scheduled meetings.

Fix:

- Admin must be able to create meeting.
- Meeting fields:
  title
  date
  time
  meetingLink
  meetingType (class / mock interview / live coding)
  assignTo (course / group / individual user)

- Student must see scheduled meetings.
- Student must be able to join using link.

---------------------------------------------------
3. ASSIGNMENTS & QUIZZES – USER TO USER QUESTIONS
---------------------------------------------------
Admin should create or send questions.

Each user must receive different question sets.

Example:
- User1 gets Set-A
- User2 gets Set-B
- User3 gets Set-C

Not global question paper.

Student must see only questions assigned to him.

---------------------------------------------------
4. EXAM MODE & RESULT AUTOMATION
---------------------------------------------------
Exam mode must:

- Show only assigned questions.
- Be timed.
- Auto submit after time ends.

After exam submission:

- Result must automatically show in student dashboard.
- Leaderboard must automatically update based on result.

---------------------------------------------------
5. GROUP CREATION & MEMBERS
---------------------------------------------------
Admin creates group.

Admin selects users and adds them to group.

Example:
Group1:
- Admin
- UserX
- UserY
- UserZ

Entire conversation only between these members.

Same logic for other groups.

---------------------------------------------------
6. GROUP FEATURES
---------------------------------------------------
Inside group:

- Group chat.
- Audio call option.
- Video call option.

Admin must:

- See group members list.
- See member names.
- Chat with members.
- Receive notifications.

---------------------------------------------------
7. ATTENDANCE AS STREAKS 
---------------------------------------------------
Attendance must be tracked.

- Attendance represented as streaks.
- Overall day wise attendence must be calculated using attendance 

---------------------------------------------------
8. LEAVE REQUEST & APPROVAL
---------------------------------------------------
Student can request leave.

Admin can approve or reject.

If admin approves leave:

- That day is considered holiday.
- Holiday must NOT reduce attendance streak.
- Holiday must be excluded from attendance calculation.

---------------------------------------------------
9. USER-SPECIFIC ROADMAP WITH LOCKING MECHANISM
---------------------------------------------------
Admin will send roadmap for every user individually.

Example roadmap:

- Python (Unlocked)
- Advanced Python (Locked)
- Django (Locked)
- SQL (Locked)

Rules:

- At user registration time, admin assigns roadmap.
- User sees roadmap with lock/unlock status.
- User must click unlocked course to start.
- Each course has fixed duration (60–90 days).
- After user completes course:
    - Admin reviews progress.
    - If admin approves → next course lock opens.
- User cannot access locked courses.
- When next course unlocks:
    - User can view roadmap.
    - User can access resources of that subject.

---------------------------------------------------
FINAL EXPECTATION
---------------------------------------------------
All above points must work end-to-end without errors.

Fix ONLY these items.
Do NOT add new features.
Do NOT redesign UI.
