You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Fix and implement the following issues exactly as described.

---------------------------------------------------
1. ADMIN PANEL REPORT STATS NOT FETCHING
---------------------------------------------------
In admin panel:

- Total students count is showing 0.
- Attendance count is showing 0.
- Top 10 performance is fetching correctly.
- Assignment score is NOT fetching.

Fix:

- Total students count must fetch correctly.
- Attendance stats must fetch correctly.
- If admin awards marks for assignment:
    - Assignment score must fetch correctly.
    - Assignment score must reflect in user panel.
    - Assignment score must reflect in admin panel.

---------------------------------------------------
2. ROADMAP RESOURCE DOWNLOAD & ACCESS APPROVAL
---------------------------------------------------
In roadmap:

- Admin uploads PDF.
- User can download PDF.

Problems:

- User documents are not restricted by file type.
- User requests access.
- Admin clicks approve.
- Approve button is not working correctly.

Fix:

- If admin uploads PDF → user must download PDF.
- If admin uploads image → user must download image.
- If admin uploads Word → user must download Word.
- If admin uploads text → user must download text.
- No other file types allowed.

Access Flow:

- User sends request to lock open and to access resource. 
- Admin receives request.
- Admin clicks approve.
- Approve must work.
- After approval:
    - User automatically gets access in user panel.

---------------------------------------------------
3. DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION – ENV FILES
---------------------------------------------------
Review the existing project and prepare it for real deployment.

Implement ONLY the following:

--------------------------------------------------
3.1 ADD .env FILES
--------------------------------------------------
Create environment variable files for:

- Backend
- Admin Panel
- Mobile App

--------------------------------------------------
3.2 AUTO-DETECT REQUIRED VARIABLES
--------------------------------------------------
Scan the entire codebase and:

- Find every usage of process.env and import.meta.env
- Identify ALL required environment variables automatically.

For each environment (Backend, Admin Panel, Mobile App):

- Create a .env file
- List ONLY the variables actually used in the code
- Place empty placeholders for values

DO NOT hardcode any variable names manually.
DO NOT guess variables.
Only include variables found in the project.

--------------------------------------------------
3.3 SECURITY RULES
--------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT hardcode secrets.
- Load all env values using environment files.
- Add .env to .gitignore.
- Validate missing env variables on server start.

--------------------------------------------------
3.4 MOBILE APP CONFIRMATION
--------------------------------------------------
Ensure the mobile app loads its environment variables correctly and runs without errors.

---------------------------------------------------
FINAL EXPECTATION
---------------------------------------------------
All above functionalities should work properly without any fail.

Fix ONLY these items.
Do NOT add new features.
Do NOT redesign UI.
