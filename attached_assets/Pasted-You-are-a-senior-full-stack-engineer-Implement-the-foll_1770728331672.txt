You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Implement the following STRICT REQUIREMENTS in an LMS system:

1. HIDDEN ADMIN LOGIN
--------------------------------
- There must be NO visible Admin login button anywhere in the UI.
- Admin login route must be hidden (example: /secure-admin-auth).
- Admin users can only be created by:
    - Database seeding
    - Or a protected SuperAdmin API.
- On login, fetch user role from backend.
- Role-based redirect:
    - role === "ADMIN" → /admin/dashboard
    - role === "STUDENT" → /student/dashboard
- Enforce backend role guards on all admin APIs.
- Prevent students from accessing admin routes even via URL manipulation.

2. ROLE-BASED AUTHENTICATION
--------------------------------
- Single login API for all users.
- JWT Access + Refresh Tokens.
- Password hashing (bcrypt).
- Middleware must validate:
    - Authentication
    - Authorization (role)
- Admin permissions must be server-side enforced (not frontend only).

3. CLOUDINARY STORAGE (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------
Use Cloudinary for ALL file storage.
NO local disk storage.

Cloudinary folders:
- lms/course-images → course thumbnails & banners
- lms/course-pdfs → syllabus & learning PDFs
- lms/assignments → admin-posted task files
- lms/submissions → student assignment uploads

Database must store ONLY Cloudinary URLs.

4. COURSE IMAGE HANDLING
--------------------------------
- Admin uploads course images.
- Images must be stored in Cloudinary.
- Image URL saved in database.
- Optimized image delivery (auto format, auto quality).

5. PDF & TASK STORAGE
--------------------------------
- Admin uploads PDFs for:
    - Courses
    - Assignments
    - Tasks
- Files uploaded directly to Cloudinary.
- Secure file validation (type & size).
- Student downloads use Cloudinary URLs.

6. ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION STORAGE
--------------------------------
- Student uploads assignment solutions.
- Files stored in Cloudinary.
- Each submission linked to:
    - Student ID
    - Assignment ID
    - Course ID
- Submission status tracked in database.

7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------
- Block direct access to admin routes without ADMIN role.
- CSRF protection.
- Rate limiting on login.
- File type validation.
- Secure environment variables for Cloudinary keys.

8. IMPLEMENTATION OUTPUT
--------------------------------
Generate:
- Backend auth middleware
- Role guard logic
- Cloudinary upload service
- Secure admin routing
- Database fields for file URLs
- End-to-end working integration

NO dummy data.
NO hardcoded content.
ADMIN controls all uploads.
Production-ready code only.
